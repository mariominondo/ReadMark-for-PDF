# ReadMark: Your Automatic PDF Page Marker

**Never lose your place in a PDF document again. ReadMark is a lightweight browser extension that automatically saves your last viewed page and instantly returns you to it on your next visit.**

---

### Short Description

Reading long PDF documents in your browser can be frustrating. You close the tab and your position is lost. ReadMark solves this single problem with a "fire-and-forget" solution: it seamlessly bookmarks your page in the background, ensuring your reading flow is never interrupted.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Automatic Page Saving:** No need to click any buttons. Your progress is saved the moment you turn a page.
* **Instant Page Restore:** Opens your PDF documents exactly where you left off.
* **Lightweight & Fast:** Built to be unobtrusive and have no impact on your browser's performance.
* **Privacy-Focused:** All data is stored locally on your browser. Nothing is ever sent to a server.
* **PDF Focused:** Activates only on PDF files, staying out of your way everywhere else.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

ReadMark leverages the native capabilities of modern Chromium-based browsers (like Google Chrome, Brave, and Edge).

1.  **Page Detection:** It monitors the URL for a hash change (e.g., `document.pdf#page=5`), which the browser's native PDF viewer uses to track the current page.
2.  **Local Storage:** When a page change is detected, ReadMark saves the page number and the PDF's URL into your browser's local storage using the `chrome.storage` API.
3.  **Automatic Restoration:** The next time you open that same PDF, the extension checks if a saved page exists for that URL and automatically navigates you there.
